# CLI Chess

This is a command-line interface (CLI) chess program written in C++. It allows two players to play chess against each other on the same computer, using algebraic notation to specify their moves.
# Features

    Allows two players to play chess against each other on the same computer.
    Supports basic moves, including pawn promotion
    Validates moves according to the rules of chess.

# How to Play

The program will display an empty chessboard, with each square represented by a two-digit number from 11 to 88. The first digit represents the row (1-8), and the second digit represents the column (1-8).

To make a move, the player must enter the starting square and the ending square as two-digit numbers.

For example, to move the pawn from e2 to e4, the first player would enter:

* 5254

This means that the pawn on square 52 (e2) is moved to square 54 (e4). The program will then validate the move and update the chessboard accordingly. The program will then prompt the second player to enter their move.

The game will continue until one player loses it's king.
